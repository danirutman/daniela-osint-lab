# 1. Executive Summary
<div align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report provides a verified chronological and geospatial analysis of two distinct rocket and missile impact events across Israel occurring between October 25 and November 5, 2023. This analysis is purposefully limited to two representative incidents, selected due to their geographic diversity and the high availability of corroborating digital evidence. By focusing on these specific events, the report serves as a transparent record for humanitarian, policy and security-based assessments. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-Source Intelligence analysis confirms a systematic pattern of impact events involving both Hamas (Southern/Central) and Hezbollah (Northern) munitions targeting civilian infrastructure, including residential areas and medical facilities. High-confidence verification was achieved across all incidents through the rigorous cross-correlation of media forensics, official IDF, emergency service alerts and precise geospatial triangulation. Furthermore, the compiled data visualization illustrates a clear strategic shift in impact density, moving from the Gaza envelope and Tel Aviv metropolitan area in October toward the Northern border by early November. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings presented were derived using non-classified techniques designed for maximum reproducibility and transparency. The investigative process relied on three primary pillars: geospatial triangulation, including User-Generated Content (UGC), against satellite imagery, chronological mapping to correlate Red Alert (Tzeva Adom) data with media timestamps and metadata validation through a forensic audit of photographic evidence. This multi-vector analysis ensures the integrity of the verification and provides a reliable account of the events documented in this report.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.1.Data Collection Framework**
<div align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All information contained within this report was obtained through Open-Source Intelligence techniques, focusing exclusively on publicly available and verifiable data. The collection process was categorized into five distinct segments to ensure a multi-dimensional view of each event. Visual evidence was gathered from resources published by reputable media organizations, local ones and international branches, such as The Times of Israel which was subsequently subjected to geolocation to confirm physical authenticity. Official Statements were sourced from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) "Israel at War" updates and government security reports to provide an operational baseline.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was supplemented by expert analysis drawn from independent think tanks, including JINSA and the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC). Finally, Home Front Command (HFC) Alerts provided the technical logs necessary for temporal cross-validation, allowing for the precise correlation of rocket sirens with documented impacts.
