&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report provides a verified chronological and geospatial analysis of two distinct rocket and missile impact events across Israel occurring between October 25 and November 5, 2023. This analysis is purposefully limited to two representative incidents, selected due to their geographic diversity and the high availability of corroborating digital evidence. By focusing on these specific events, the report serves as a transparent record for humanitarian, policy and security-based assessments. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-Source Intelligence analysis confirms a systematic pattern of impact events involving both Hamas (Southern/Central) and Hezbollah (Northern) munitions targeting civilian infrastructure, including residential areas and medical facilities. High-confidence verification was achieved across all incidents through the rigorous cross-correlation of media forensics, official IDF, emergency service alerts and precise geospatial triangulation. Furthermore, the compiled data visualization illustrates a clear strategic shift in impact density, moving from the Gaza envelope and Tel Aviv metropolitan area in October toward the Northern border by early November. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings presented were derived using non-classified techniques designed for maximum reproducibility and transparency. The investigative process relied on three primary pillars: geospatial triangulation, including User-Generated Content (UGC), against satellite imagery, chronological mapping to correlate Red Alert (Tzeva Adom) data with media timestamps and metadata validation through a forensic audit of photographic evidence. This multi-vector analysis ensures the integrity of the verification and provides a reliable account of the events documented in this report. <br>
